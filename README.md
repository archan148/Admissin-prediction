# Admission prediction using Machine Learning

**Admission prediction using Multiple linear regression and Random forest algorithms.**

It is a regression problem and we will predict the chances of admission of a particular student by training
the dataset using above mentioned algorithms.
The output will be in the range of 0-1 if the output is less than 0.5 then there is less chance and if the
output is greater than 0.5 then their is a high chance of getting an admission.
